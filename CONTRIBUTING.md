   ```bash
   ./start-ai-team.sh
   ./initialize-agents.sh
   ```

4. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   # List active sessions
   tmux list-sessions
   
   # Test agent communication
   ./send-message.sh --list
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document new features and API changes

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **System Functionality:**
   ```bash
   # Test system startup
   ./start-ai-team.sh
   
   # Test agent initialization
   ./initialize-agents.sh
   
   # Test basic communication
   ./send-message.sh ceo "Test message"
   ```

2. **Feature Testing:**
   - Test new features in isolation
   - Verify integration with existing functionality
   - Test error conditions and edge cases

### Quality Assurance
